# Trust and Safety Teaching Consortium

This repository is the main collaboration space for the Trust and Safety Teaching Consortium, a loosely-organized coalition of academic, industry and non-profit experts in online trust and safety problems.
Our goal is to create content that can be used to teach a variety of audiences about trust and safety issues in a wide variety of formats.
