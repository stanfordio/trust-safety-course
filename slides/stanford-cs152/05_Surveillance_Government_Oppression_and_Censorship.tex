            That nation is about to get even bigger as the major commercial computer networks - Prodigy, CompuServe, America Online, GEnie and Delphi Internet Service - begin to dismantle the walls that have separated their private operations from the public Internet. The success of the Internet is a matter of frustration to the owners of the commercial networks, who have tried all sorts of marketing tricks and still count fewer than 5 million subscribers among them. Most commercial networks now allow electronic mail to pass between their services and the Internet. Delphi, which was purchased by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. in September, began providing its customers full Internet access earlier this year. America Online (which publishes an electronic version of TIME) is scheduled to begin offering limited Internet services later this month.\\~\\
            
            People who uses these new entry points into the Net may be in for a shock. Unlike the family-oriented commercial services, which censor messages they find offensive, the Internet imposes no restrictions. Anybody can start a discussion on any topic and say anything. There have been sporadic attempts by local network managers to crack down on the raunchier discussion groups, but as Internet pioneer John Gilmore puts it, \textbf{"The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it."}\\~\\

    “The right of the people to be secure in their  persons,  houses,  papers,  and effects,  against  unreasonable  searches and  seizures,  shall  not  be  violated,  and no  Warrants  shall  issue,  but  upon probable  cause,  supported  by  Oath  or affirmation,  and  particularly  describing the  place  to  be  searched,  and  the persons or things to be seized.”\\

\begin{frame}{Key US Laws}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In 1968, after \textit{Berger} and \textif{Katz}, Congress passed original Wiretap Act
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Enacted as Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item In 1986, Congress passed ECPA
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Amended the Wiretap Act (now Title I of ECPA) -- extended it to include transmissions of electronic data via computers. 18 U.S.C. § 2510 \textit{et seq.}
            \item Added the Stored Communications Act (Title II of ECPA) -- applies to stored electronic communications. 18 U.S.C. § 2701 \textit{et seq.}
            \item Added the Pen Register Statute (Title III of ECPA). 18 U.S.C. § 3121 \textit{et seq.}
        \end{itemize}

        \item Remember: 4A is a \textit{floor}; Congress can and does pass laws that provide \textit{more} protection than the courts say the 4A provides.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{ECPA Definitions}
    \textbf{Contents: "substance, purport, or meaning"} of the communication
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What the communication means, conveys, says
        \item Example: subject line + body of an email (or contents of a snail-mail letter)\\~\\
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Non-content} information = information \textbf{about} the communication
    \begin{itemize}
        \item "Metadata"
        \item Think: header of an email (or the outside of the envelope the letter is sealed in)\\~\\
    \end{itemize}
    
    Content/non-content distinction becomes really blurry in the context of the Internet
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Internet's complex architecture means one particular unit of data might change status (from content to non-content, or vice versa) as it travels from sender to recipient
        \item Content or non-content status might also depend on where in the network that unit of data resides at that particular moment in time
        \item We no longer live in the world of \textit{Katz} and \textit{Smight} -- hence calls for reforming ECPA
